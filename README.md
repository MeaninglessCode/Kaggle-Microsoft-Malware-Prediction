# Data Mining Course Project
This project contains code written to complete the [Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) challenge on Kaggle. All code was written as our group's independent data mining course project.

The data files used in this challenge are too large to commit them to this repository. To use them with this code, download them from the Kaggle challenge link and put them in `Data-Mining-Course-Project/assets/raw/`.
